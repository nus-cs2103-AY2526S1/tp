* This is **StudentConnect, an application that helps private tutors to connect to their students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * As a private tutor, I want to be able to add my studentsâ€™ contacts so that I can remember them 
  * As a private tutor I want to be able to delete a student contact if I am no longer teaching them
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `StudentConnect` built on the project `AddressBook3` as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Tutor connect Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f09-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
